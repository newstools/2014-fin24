New York - Actavis plans to acquire Botox-maker Allergan for $66bn to 
create one of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies by sales, the 
companies announced Monday. The companies said the deal would 
result in $1.8bn in annual cost savings, improved marketing 
success by combining sales forces and expanded reach into key growth 
markets in Asia and Latin America. "We will establish an unrivaled
 foundation for long-term growth, anchored by leading, world-class 
blockbuster franchises and a premier late-stage pipeline that will 
accelerate our commitment to build an exceptional, sustainable 
portfolio," said Brent Saunders, chief executive of Actavis. Actavis
 will pay $219 per share for Allergan in a mix of cash and Actavis 
shares, with the deal totalling approximately $66 billion. Actavis is 
headquartered in Dublin and has administrative headquarters in the US in
 the state of New Jersey. Meanwhile rival bidder Valeant announced
 it would not raise its bid. Valeant has pursued Allergan since April, 
but was repeatedly met with refusals to enter negotiations. Three 
weeks ago, Valeant floated raising its bid by $10bn to $60bn
 by offering "at least $200 a share" for the US company. Monday's 
transaction is subject to shareholder votes by both Actavis and 
Allergan. The companies expect the deal to close in the second quarter 
of 2015. In early trade, Allergan shares jumped 6.7% to 
$211.86, Actavis rose 3.4% to $252.01 and Valeant advanced 0.3% to $134.61.
